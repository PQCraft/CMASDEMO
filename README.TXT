This is a Christmas demo I made.

Source Code: DEMO.BAS
Music file:  SPF.SND
Read me:     README.TXT (this file)

Run DEMO.{ELF/EXE} to see the demo (compile or download).

Use [Alt + Enter] to change the fullscreen mode.
use [Alt + F4] to close.

The source code is in DEMO.BAS and needs to be compiled by QB64
(QB64 1.4 was used to compile the included executable.)

The audio file, SPF.SND, is an MS-DOS style Dance of the Sugar Plum Faries.

This program is open-source.

Your antivirus may flag this program as harmfull. (mine does)

The source code is in DEMO.BAS and needs to be compiled by QB64
(QB64 1.4 was used to compile the included executable.)

The audio file, SPF.SND, is an MS-DOS style Dance of the Sugar Plum Faries.

The read me file is what you are reading right now.

This program is open-source.

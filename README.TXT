This is a Christmas demo I made.

Program:     DEMO.EXE
Source Code: DEMO.BAS
Music file:  SPF.SND
Read me:     README.TXT (this file)

Run DEMO.EXE to see the demo.
Your antivirus may flag this program as harmfull. (mine does)
This is due to the bootstrap it uses, which has to do some tricks to make the
files load in with the 8.3 MS-DOS format.

The source code is in DEMO.BAS and needs to be compiled by QB64
(QB64 1.4 was used to compile the included executable.)

The audio file, SPF.SND, is an MS-DOS style Dance of the Sugar Plum Faries.

The read me file is what you are reading right now.

This program is open-source.
